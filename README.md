# Pomodoro App
The Pomodoro technique is a popular time management method developed in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo. The Pomodoro method works like this: you set a countdown timer for 25 minutes and get to work. This one 25-minute unit of work is called a pomodoro. When the timer rings, you take a 5-minute break. After completing your fourth pomodoro, you take a longer break of 20 or 30 minutes. Then, you start a new pomodoro. Repeat the process of focus sessions separated by short breaks until you finish all the items on your to-do list.

I'm Learning ReactJS so I decided to build a Pomodoro App with above mention methods. If you didn't used any Pomodoro App, I would hightly recommend you, use this one. give this repo a star if you like.

## to use this app
- first clone it with  `git clone https://github.com/charlie0x01/react-pomodoro-app.git`
- move into the clone directory and open a terminal in that directory
- run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- run `npm run dev` to run the project
- then head over to your browser and visit this url `http://localhost:5173`
